Learned to start small.
Ignore the details and focus on a minimal implementation.
For example, I initially wanted to deal with quoted strings, with double and single quotes, with how
to identity the indentation,  etc - but that's all details that I can get to work later.
What I decided to do instead is focus on the mapping type - because it is fundamental. I have purposely not dealt with arrays yet.
